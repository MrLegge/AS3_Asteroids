# AS3_Asteroids

This is the basic unfinished code developed to this stage with my 2020 computer programming stage 5 class in term 4.

A nod to the original developers of this simple addictive little game that has some achievable mathematical challenges within.

A note for other educators this code is the base level solution, the students are encouraged to add finesse such as clean wrapping (rather than the teleport of objects as it is)

The priorities on the development of the solutions have been driven by student interest and creating a usable starting point.
